# ðŸ§± Relational Database Design â€“ Users, Roles & Accounts

## ðŸ“Œ Project Objective
This project focuses on translating a relational database design into a working schema in SQL Server. It involves defining relationships between users, their roles, account statuses, and linking everything using primary and foreign keys. This exercise strengthens understanding of data modeling, schema creation, and referential integrity.
