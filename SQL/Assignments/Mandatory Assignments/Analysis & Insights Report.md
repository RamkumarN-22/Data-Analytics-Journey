SQL Assignment â€“ Analysis & Insights Report

ðŸ“Œ 1. Data Integrity & Constraint Implementation
Primary Key (salesmanid) ensures that each salesman has a unique ID, preventing duplicate entries.
Foreign Key (salesmanid in customer_table) enforces referential integrity, ensuring every customer is linked to a valid salesman.
NOT NULL (customername) ensures that customer records always have a name, preventing incomplete data.
DEFAULT (city = 'unknown') ensures new records have a meaningful value even if city is not provided.

ðŸ“Œ 2. Handling Invalid Data Before Adding Constraints
Before adding the foreign key, I checked for salesmanid values in customer_table that did not exist in salesman_table.
Solution Chosen: Instead of adding missing salesmanid values to salesman_table, I deleted invalid records from customer_table to maintain data accuracy.

ðŸ“Œ 3. Data Filtering & Retrieval Analysis
Customer Name Ending with â€˜Nâ€™ & Purchase Amount > 500

Used LIKE '%n' to filter names ending with â€˜Nâ€™.
Used BETWEEN 500 AND 1500 to restrict purchase amounts within a specific range.
Using SET Operators (UNION & INTERSECT)

UNION retrieves unique salesmanid values from salesman_table and customer_table.
INTERSECT retrieves common salesmanid values, meaning only salesmen linked to customers.
Joining salesman_table, customer_table, and orders_table

INNER JOIN used to fetch matching salesmanid records across tables.
RIGHT JOIN ensures all order records appear even if some do not have an assigned salesman.

ðŸ“Œ 4. Business Insights from the Queries
Some customer_table records had invalid salesmanid values, which could indicate incorrect data entry or missing sales records.
The RIGHT JOIN query showed some orders were placed without a valid salesman, which could be an issue in real business scenarios.
The default city constraint ('unknown') ensures consistency in the dataset for missing location data.
