# 📝 Hands-on Assignment 5  

## 📌 **Overview**  
This assignment is part of the **Intellipaat SQL training program** and focuses on **SQL clauses and SET operators** to manipulate and compare datasets efficiently.  

## 🛠 **Skills Covered**  
✔ Sorting Data (`ORDER BY`)  
✔ Creating and Managing Tables (`CREATE TABLE`)  
✔ Combining Data with **SET Operators** (`UNION`, `INTERSECT`, `EXCEPT`)  

## 📂 **Files Included**  
- **SQL_Assignment_Prob_Stat_5.pdf** → Contains the problem statement.  
- **SQL_Script.sql** → Contains all SQL queries for the assignment.  
- **README.md** → Documentation and details about this assignment.  

## 📖 **Assignment Tasks**  

| #  | Task Description | SQL Concept Used |
|----|----------------|----------------|
| 1  | Arrange the `Orders` dataset in **decreasing order of amount**. | `ORDER BY DESC` |
| 2  | Create `Employee_details1` and `Employee_details2` tables. | `CREATE TABLE` |
| 3  | Apply the **UNION** operator on both employee tables. | `UNION` |
| 4  | Apply the **INTERSECT** operator on both employee tables. | `INTERSECT` |
| 5  | Apply the **EXCEPT** operator on both employee tables. | `EXCEPT` |


## 🚀 **Execution Instructions**  
1. **Sort** the `Orders` dataset in descending order based on `amount`.  
2. **Create** `Employee_details1` and `Employee_details2` tables with the required structure.  
3. **Insert sample records** into both tables.  
4. **Run** the `UNION`, `INTERSECT`, and `EXCEPT` queries to observe differences in the datasets.  
5. **Verify results** and adjust queries if necessary.  

## 📢 **Notes**  
- This assignment helps in understanding **data sorting and combining datasets efficiently**.  
- Ensure the **tables are created and populated** before applying **SET operators**.  
- `UNION` returns **unique** combined rows, while `INTERSECT` finds **common** rows, and `EXCEPT` shows **differences** between two datasets.
