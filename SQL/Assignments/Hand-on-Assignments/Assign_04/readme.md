# 📝 Hands-on Assignment 4  

## 📌 **Overview**  
This assignment is part of the **Intellipaat SQL training program** and focuses on using **inbuilt functions and user-defined functions** for data manipulation and conditional logic in SQL.  

## 🛠 **Skills Covered**  
✔ Aggregate Functions (`MIN`, `MAX`, `AVG`)  
✔ User-Defined Functions (`CREATE FUNCTION`)  
✔ Conditional Logic using `CASE` Statements  
✔ Data Filtering with Functions  

## 📂 **Files Included**  
- **SQL_Assignment_Prob_Stat_4.pdf** → Contains the problem statement.  
- **SQL_Script.sql** → Contains all SQL queries for the assignment.  
- **README.md** → Documentation and details about this assignment.  

## 📖 **Assignment Tasks**  

| #  | Task Description | SQL Concept Used |
|----|----------------|----------------|
| 1  | Find the **minimum, maximum, and average amount** from the `Orders` table. | `MIN`, `MAX`, `AVG` |
| 2  | Create a **user-defined function** to multiply a given number by 10. | `CREATE FUNCTION` |
| 3  | Use a `CASE` statement to check if 100 is less than, greater than, or equal to 200. | `CASE` |
| 4  | Determine the **status of the amount** as High, Medium, or Low using a `CASE` statement. | `CASE` |
| 5  | Create a **user-defined function** to fetch amounts greater than a given input. | `CREATE FUNCTION`, `WHERE` |

## 🚀 **Execution Instructions**  
1. **Run** the aggregate function queries on the `Orders` table.  
2. **Create** and **execute** the user-defined functions for multiplication and amount filtering.  
3. **Implement** and test the `CASE` statement logic for comparisons and amount status.  
4. **Verify results** and optimize queries if necessary.  

## 📢 **Notes**  
- This assignment strengthens **SQL function usage and conditional logic**.  
- Ensure the `Orders` table exists before running queries.  
- User-defined functions must be **declared before use** in SQL.

Would you like me to add sample SQL queries for each task? 😊🚀
