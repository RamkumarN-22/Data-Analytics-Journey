# 📝 Hands-on Assignment 2  

## 📌 **Overview**  
This assignment is part of the **Intellipaat SQL training program** and focuses on **creating tables, inserting data, and filtering records using the `WHERE` clause and basic operators**.  

## 🛠 **Skills Covered**  
✔ Creating Tables (`CREATE TABLE`)  
✔ Inserting Data (`INSERT INTO`)  
✔ Selecting Specific Columns (`SELECT`)  
✔ Filtering Data (`WHERE`, `LIKE`, `NOT LIKE`)  
✔ String Functions & Conditions (`STARTS WITH`, `ENDS WITH`)  

## 📂 **Files Included**  
- **SQL_Assignment_Prob_Stat_2.pdf** → Contains the problem statement.  
- **SQL_Script.sql** → Contains all SQL queries for the assignment.  
- **README.md** → Documentation and details about this assignment.  

## 📖 **Assignment Tasks**  

| #  | Task Description | SQL Concept Used |
|----|----------------|----------------|
| 1  | Create a `customer` table with multiple columns. | `CREATE TABLE` |
| 2  | Insert 5 new records into the customer table. | `INSERT INTO` |
| 3  | Select only `first_name` and `last_name` from the customer table. | `SELECT` |
| 4  | Retrieve records where `first_name` starts with "G" and city is 'San Jose'. | `WHERE`, `LIKE`, `AND` |
| 5  | Retrieve records where the email contains only 'gmail'. | `WHERE`, `LIKE` |
| 6  | Retrieve records where `last_name` doesn't end with "A". | `WHERE`, `NOT LIKE` |

## 🚀 **Execution Instructions**  
1. **Create** the `customer` table using the provided SQL script.  
2. **Insert** the sample records.  
3. **Run the `SELECT` queries** to filter and retrieve specific data.  
4. **Verify results** and modify queries if necessary.  

## 📢 **Notes**  
- This assignment strengthens SQL **table creation and filtering skills**.  
- The dataset is **user-defined**, and records must be inserted manually.  
- Ensure to use correct **data types** when creating the table.
