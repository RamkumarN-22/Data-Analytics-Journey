# 📝 Hands-on Assignment 3  

## 📌 **Overview**  
This assignment is part of the **Intellipaat SQL training program** and focuses on **working with joins and update statements** to manipulate relational database tables.  

## 🛠 **Skills Covered**  
✔ Creating Tables (`CREATE TABLE`)  
✔ Inserting Data (`INSERT INTO`)  
✔ Using **Joins** (`INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, `RIGHT JOIN`, `FULL OUTER JOIN`)  
✔ Updating Data (`UPDATE`)  

## 📂 **Files Included**  
- **SQL_Assignment_Prob_Stat_3.pdf** → Contains the problem statement.  
- **SQL_Script.sql** → Contains all SQL queries for the assignment.  
- **README.md** → Documentation and details about this assignment.  

## 📖 **Assignment Tasks**  

| #  | Task Description | SQL Concept Used |
|----|----------------|----------------|
| 1  | Create an `Orders` table with relevant columns. | `CREATE TABLE` |
| 2  | Insert 5 new records into the `Orders` table. | `INSERT INTO` |
| 3  | Perform an **INNER JOIN** on `Customer` and `Orders` tables using `customer_id`. | `INNER JOIN` |
| 4  | Perform **LEFT JOIN** and **RIGHT JOIN** on `Customer` and `Orders` tables. | `LEFT JOIN`, `RIGHT JOIN` |
| 5  | Perform a **FULL OUTER JOIN** on `Customer` and `Orders` tables. | `FULL OUTER JOIN` |
| 6  | Update the `Orders` table to set `amount = 100` where `customer_id = 3`. | `UPDATE` |

## 🚀 **Execution Instructions**  
1. **Create** the `Orders` table using the provided SQL script.  
2. **Insert** the sample records into the table.  
3. **Execute the `JOIN` queries** to explore relationships between `Customer` and `Orders`.  
4. **Run the `UPDATE` query** to modify specific records in the `Orders` table.  
5. **Verify results** and optimize queries if necessary.  

## 📢 **Notes**  
- This assignment strengthens SQL **relational concepts** through joins and updates.  
- Ensure the `Customer` table exists before performing `JOIN` operations.  
- Review the **JOIN results** carefully to understand data relationships.

Would you like me to add sample SQL queries for each task? 😊🚀
